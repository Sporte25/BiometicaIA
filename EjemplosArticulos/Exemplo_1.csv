"Application of machine learning missing data imputation techniques in clinical decision making: taking the discharge assessment of patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage as an example",
"There are often many missing values in medical data, which directly affect the accuracy 
of clinical decision making. Discharge assessment is an important part 
of clinical decision making. Taking the discharge assessment of patients with spontaneous 
supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage as an example, this study adopted the missing data processing 
evaluation criteria more suitable for clinical decision making, aiming at systematically exploring the 
performance and applicability of single machine learning algorithms and ensemble learning (EL) under 
different data missing scenarios, as well as whether they had more advantages than traditional methods, 
so as to provide basis and reference for the selection of suitable missing data processing method in practical clinical decision making."
